# MIPT2020-21_Bot_Project
This is a telegram bot, that makes style transfer! The code is in Bot.py file. The Bot address is @MIPT2020PictureProject_Bot

First reseived image is considered as content image, the second received - as style image.

For now, as the bot works on my own computer, it makes images smaller, so that the processing wouldn't take ages.
